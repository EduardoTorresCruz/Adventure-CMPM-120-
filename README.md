A simple adventure game by Eduardo Torres Cruz based on a simple adventure game engine by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly).

Code requirements:
- **4+ scenes based on `AdventureScene`**: Bedroom, Work
- **2+ scenes *not* based on `AdventureScene`**: Real_Intro
- **2+ methods or other enhancement added to the adventure game engine to simplify my scenes**:
    - Enhancement 1: highlighOnHover() - sets the tint to the object to a eggwhite color when hovered over only(when hovered out it returns to its original color)
    - Enhancement 2: unsatisfied (name the method and explain the use of it).

Experience requirements:
- **4+ locations in the game world**: unsatisfied (name at least 4 of the classes).
- **2+ interactive objects in most scenes**: unsatisfied (describe two examples)
- **Many objects have `pointerover` messages**: unsatisfied (describe two examples)
- **Many objects have `pointerdown` effects**: unsatisfied (describe two examples)
- **Some objects are themselves animated**: unsatisfied (describe two examples)
